# Multi-Threaded-Online-Book-Store-Management
In the following assignment I implemented an online book store with a delivery option based on Micro-Service framework . This code is part of my solution for assigmnet 2 in Systems Programming Course BGU University (SPL191)

### Assignment Definition 
In the following assignment I implemented a simple Micro-Service framework, which I then use to implement an online book store with a delivery option. 
This assignment is composed of two main sections:
  1. Building a simple Micro-Service framework.
  2. Implementing an online books store application on top of this framework.
  
 The implementation of the book store is multi-threaded , meaning the solution includes synchronization, avoiding deadlocks or liveness while keeping the program correctness and consistency .
